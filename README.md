# UT Mart Sales Analytics

###  Overview 

UT Discount mart is a small American supermarket.
To recap on the ending year, the sales department requests a dashboard where to track how well Discount Mart has done(in terms of Sales, Profit and Order Quantity).  
To understand where the supermarket still needs to grow and where it is thriving, the request included a more detailed outlook at the metrics with regards to categories of objects sold as well as different regions.  

Therefore, a csv file containing was handed to me for the purpose of creating a highly informative dashboard that will be the basis of future decisions.

Per his requirements, an interactive dashboard was created to analyse the supermarket performance.
